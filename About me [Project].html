<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I see a purposeful and versatile vocation in human biology, yet what I love most is its fusion of how the body functions in conjunction with a programme that covers a broad spectrum of sports performance.</p> 

  My excitement for learning about the anatomy of the body was sparked when I got to experience a day at University, investigating with my peers to discover our VO2 max, and blood lactate levels. This was one of the most interesting yet exhausting experiences of my life and although it was emotionally and physically demanding, it instilled in me a resolute desire to study human biology. Additionally, this enabled me to engage my critical thinking skills to include this in my future training.</p>  
  
  Becoming invested in the biology of how the body functions, I knew the synergy of core maths would pay dividends in helping me optimise my grades. One specific example is standard deviation, due to its crossing over between both subjects I can now excel in answering this topic to my best. Additionally, due to the statistical nature of Biology, I dedicated myself to completing an extra GCSE in statistics. Despite the extra work I would have to take on, I balanced my revision successfully alongside my extra-curricular and A-levels.</p>      
   
  From competing in local high school cross-country meetings to the National level, I started to understand why incorporating a set routine strength and conditioning programme would allow me to optimise my performanceâ€”doing my own research outside of school, reading a book called the "Science of running", I discovered that S&C is a vital fitness component for runners, as it can allow the athlete to handle training load and has been shown to improve performance. By applying the philosophy of S&C, I experienced an immense leap in performance, from being ranked 40th for 3000m to 4th in the UK, as well as setting an all-time u15 5k record. The importance of S&C enabled me to develop into a more consistent, healthy runner.</p>    
  
  For the last 2 years, every 6 weeks, I have been visiting Physio-fit. As an athlete, this led to me becoming fascinated by how a Sports Physiotherapist can aid elite athletes' recovery/rehab. One specific experience was my physiotherapist helping me overcome imbalances in my running form, preventing the risk of injury.</p>
                    
  The fusion of my talent and hard work has not gone unrecognised. Recently I was selected to join the Junior National Talent Program (JNTP), where they will be working with me to succeed in running to the next level, in conjunction with balancing a dual career and achieving a degree in what I aspire to do in the future. The JNTP lays the foundations for athletes to participate in workshops spread across the year, such as, diet and nutrition. I was eager to jump in and listen, learning about how beetroot juice has been shown to improve exercise stamina.</p>  
  
  Winning the Regional, Northern and National Road Relays Championships helped me hone both my leadership and team-working skills. As a specific example, there was a disagreement among the team about which leg each of us would run and I was able to discuss it calmly with each member and suggest that we let our head coach decide which leg would be best for us to maximise a great result. This helped me develop skills such as empathy and conflict resolution by engaging with other team members to understand their points of view.</p>
      
  I aspire to succeed in running, as a result I have become more organised on how I balance my social, athletic and academic life. A prime example of this was being able to pursue 11 GCSEs, at the same time being able to motivate myself to train seven times a week and progressing onto achieving that same summer a national standard in the 3000m.</p>
